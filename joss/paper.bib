abstract = {Programming languages evolve in response to external and internal factors. External factors include new hardware, new theory or foundational research, trends or fashions in languages, and applications. Internal factors include a change in the way a language is used or the discovery of problems or deficiencies with existing features. However, evolving programming languages can be problematic; evaluating the impact of changes is difficult and it is often unclear how to effectively co-evolve software written in the language. The PLE workshop was initiated to bring together researchers to discuss and tackle these problems.The papers and talks presented at this workshop provided an excellent start to this new workshop and raised many interesting issues relating to programming language evolution. This document briefly reports on the activities of the first workshop, which was co-located with ECOOP 2014 in Uppsala, Sweden, July 2014.},
