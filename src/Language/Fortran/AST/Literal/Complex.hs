-- | A COMPLEX literal, composed of a real part and an imaginary part.

-- Fortran has lots of rules on how COMPLEX literals are defined and used in
-- various contexts. To support all that, we define the syntactic structure
-- 'ComplexLit' to wrap all the parsing rules. Then during a analysis pass, you
-- may (attempt to) convert these into a more regular type, like a Haskell
-- @(Double, Double)@ tuple.

-- | A part (either real or imaginary) of a complex literal.
--
-- Since Fortran 2003, complex literal parts support named constants, which must
-- be resolved in context at compile time (R422, R423).
--
-- Some compilers also allow constant expressions for the parts, and must
-- evaluate at compile time. That's not allowed in any standard. Apparently,
-- gfortran and ifort don't allow it, while nvfortran does. See:
-- https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/complex-constants-and-variables/2909/3
--
-- We specifically avoid supporting that by defining complex parts without being
-- mutually recursive with 'Expression'.
